This project analyzes and forecasts daily electricity demand for six major U.S. power system operators using classical time-series models.  
The forecasting layer handles model fitting and validation.
Problem Statement: You are a consultant hired by The Wake Forest University Energy Corporation (WFUEC), which advises regional energy companies on operational efficiency and economic output. WFUEC is preparing a report on regional electricity use, and your goal is to identify key temporal patterns and forecast short-term demand.
They have provided you with a dataset derived from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). WFUEC wishes to examine for the seven largest balancing authorities (electric grid managing entities) in the eastern United States. You are encouraged to explore relationships between respondents for interpretation but are not required to use multivariate modeling techniques. WFUEC is particularly interested in (for every balancing authority, or Respondent in the data):
• Patterns and growth in electricity demand.
• Sudden changes or anomalies in the demand patterns.
• Short-term forecasts (weekly demand from 1 to 12 weeks into 2025) to guide operational planning.
• Peak (maximum) daily demand estimates in the next 12 weeks.
Your modeling should be statistically defensible and forecasts should include appropriate uncertainty quantification. You are free to choose specific modeling and forecasting strategies, but choices should be justified by exploratory analyses and quantitative evidence.
