This project analyzes and forecasts daily electricity demand for six major U.S. power system operators using classical time-series models.  
The emphasis is not only on point forecasting accuracy, but on **forecast uncertainty, peak-demand risk, and model robustness**, which are central to real-world operational and financial risk management.
